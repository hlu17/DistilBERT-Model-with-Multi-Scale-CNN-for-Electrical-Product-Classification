# DistilBERT Model with Multi-Scale CNN for Electrical Product Classification
Market intelligence for electrical product distribution requires sophisticated product classification to capture market share for different product categories, customer segments, and geographic regions. This study focuses on product invoice descriptions provided by manufacturers and retail stores. We performed baseline models, including a simple neural network (NN), a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a pre-trained model DistilBERT(a light version of BERT) to extract textual features. After comparing the baseline models, DistilBERT stands out as the best-performing model. We applied multi-scale CNN layers to the DistilBERT model to improve the performance. Our final DistilBERT with multi-scale CNN kernels achieved 0.875 accuracies and an F1-score of 0.889.
